# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-k-mean-Clustering
Developed a Mall Customer Segmentation model using K-Means clustering in Python, leveraging pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to analyze customer purchasing behavior.
Mall Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning, specifically the K-Means clustering algorithm, to analyze and group mall customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to help businesses understand customer patterns and make data-driven marketing decisions.

Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial task in retail analytics. In this project, a dataset containing customer details such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score is analyzed to identify distinct customer groups. By applying K-Means clustering, customers are segmented into meaningful clusters that represent different purchasing behaviors.

Objectives

Understand customer purchasing patterns

Group customers into distinct segments

Visualize clusters for better interpretation

Assist businesses in targeted marketing and customer retention strategies

Dataset

The dataset includes the following key features:

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Annual Income

Spending Score

Tools & Technologies Used

Python

pandas – data manipulation and analysis

NumPy – numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

scikit-learn – K-Means clustering and model implementation

Jupyter Notebook – development and analysis environment

Methodology

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature selection for clustering

Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method

Applying K-Means clustering

Visualizing customer segments

Results

The model successfully segments customers into multiple clusters, each representing a unique group with similar spending behavior and income levels. These insights can be used for:

Personalized marketing campaigns

Product recommendation strategies

Customer loyalty programs

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of unsupervised machine learning in retail analytics. It provides clear insights into customer behavior and highlights how clustering techniques can support business decision-making.
